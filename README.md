### AI Peer Review of Standard Model of Physics vs 4D GEM EOS via ChatGPT with Wolfram Plugin

**abstract**

AI Peer Review prompt is generated in analytic domain for ChatGPT-Wolfram plugin to choose a computational 4D spacetime AI worldview between the [Standard Model of Physics](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model) vs 4D gravitoelectromagnetic equation of state (4D GEM EOS) 4D spatially-extended photon-electron soliton gauge group. Wherein 4D GEM EOS Mathematica¬Æ theorem proving operator computationally reproduces `ForAll` wavelengths and energy levels the quantum mechanical observables to all 31 and 34 decimal places in units of _pascals_ rendering along the perfect metric pressure trace of **T**ùùÅùùÇ the total field spin-stress energy momentum density tensor pressure of the observed 4D spacetime universe exceeding the requirements of the _Yang-Mills-Navier-Stokes_ problem definitions. Subject area of AI Peer Review prompt/response coincides with general inter-disciplinary range of human-ai worldview interests including Elementary Particle Physics 2024 Committee, QNetworks Workshop 2023, [The Royal Institution](https://www.rigb.org), [CERN](https://www.home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-mission), Allen Institute for Brain Science, and Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness, [Max Planck Institutes](https://www.mpg.de/en/search?searchfield=consciousness),[ Australian National University Centre for Consciousness](https://philosophy.cass.anu.edu.au/centres/consciousness), [ChatGPT-n](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Kaggle AI Report](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2023-kaggle-ai-report/overview), [Communications in Mathematical Physics](https://www.springer.com/journal/220/ethics-and-disclosures), [TED](https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization), among a multitude of academic groups. towards computationally reproducing a general information field theory AI world view using this template for a response adding an AI Response section and conclusion. Mathematical multiverse theorists can modify prompt section to test variations to Standard Model conjectures and Beyond Standard Model further variations towards computationally reproducing observed 4D spacetime universe and therefore record any progress in future Kaggle AI Reports.

**Introduction**

Greek natural philosophy atomists-materialism of Aristotle-Democritus gets all the press while the Greek theory of forms of Plato-Parmenides has formed quantum information field theory. Hence the present ai-peer review prompt starts with the present state of The School of Athens debate: A Deepening Crisis Forces Physicists to Rethink Structure of Nature‚Äôs Laws [1] many-body problem on the universal(multiverse!) scale while the 3-body problem is proven to be computationally intractable [2].
