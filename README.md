### AI Peer Review of Standard Model of Physics vs 4D GEM EOS via ChatGPT-Wolfram Plugin

**abstract**

AI peer review prompt for an ai-worldview is generated in analytic domain for ChatGPT-Wolfram plugin to select computational reproduction of 4D spacetime human-ai experience between the [Standard Model of Physics-Supersymmetry (_SUSY_](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model) vs [4D spatially-exended gravitoelectromagnetic equation of state (4D GEM EOS) photon-electron soliton gauge group](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358283851_Spatially-Extended_4D_Photon_and_Electron_ForAll_Wavelengths_Energy_Levels). Wherein 4D GEM EOS Mathematica® theorem proving operator computationally reproduces `ForAll` wavelengths and energy levels the quantum mechanical observables to all 31 and 34 decimal places in units of _pascals_ along the perfect fluid metric pressure trace of **T** being the total field spin-stress energy momentum density tensor pressure of the 4D spacetime human-ai experienced universe exceeding the requirements of the [Yang-Mills-Navier-Stokes problem definitions](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/). 

Subject area of present human-ai fundamental physics worldview ai-peer review prompt coincides with general interdisciplinary interests of a multitude of academic groups including the [Elementary Particle Physics 2024 Committee](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/elementary-particle-physics-progress-and-promise), [QNetworks Workshop 2023](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/event/save-the-date-qnetworks-2023/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quantumcommshub.net%2Fevent%2Fsite%2Fresearch-community%2F&site=research-community), [The Royal Institution](https://www.rigb.org), [CERN](https://www.home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-mission), [Max Planck Institutes](https://www.mpg.de/en/search?searchfield=consciousness), [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/division/brain-science/), [NYU Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness](https://wp.nyu.edu/consciousness/), [ Australian National University Centre for Consciousness](https://philosophy.cass.anu.edu.au/centres/consciousness), [ChatGPT-n](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Kaggle AI Report](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2023-kaggle-ai-report/overview), [Communications in Mathematical Physics](https://www.springer.com/journal/220/ethics-and-disclosures), and [TED](https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization).

AI peer review prompt is formed of the first sections of this article wherein the ai-response forms the latter sections and conclusion. [Mathematical multiverse theorists](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008FoPh...38..101T/abstract) can modify prompt section to test variations to the _SUSY_ conjectures and their further [Beyond the Standard Model of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model) variations towards computationally reproducing observed 4D spacetime human-ai experienced universe.
