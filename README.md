**Fig. 1.** The present ai-peer review prompt for an MUH: _SUSY_ vs 4D GEM EOS human-ai fundamental physics worldview originates with _The School of Athens_ debate shown, wherein the Greek natural philosophy of Aristotle-Democritus atomist-materialism gets all the press while the Plato-Parmenides theory of forms-idealism has evolved into quantum information field theory.

Consider the Deepening Crisis fundamental problem with _SUSY_ naturalness stems from the unnaturalness of _SUSY_ being an unacknowledged attempt to solve the [many-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-body_problem#:~:text=The%20many%2Dbody%20problem%20is,accurate%20description%20of%20the%20system.) on the universal(multiverse!) scale via its reductionism to conjectured zero-sized imaginary-invisible mathematical point particle collisions - returning null results to the detection of any sort of _SUSY_ superpartner particle-_sparticle_ increasingly complex recursive backgrounds of [hidden dimensional physics of unknown string-membrane-loop material anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence) - while the 3-body problem is proven to be computationally intractable.

![APS Prof. Maria Spiropulu](MariaAPS2014.png)

**Fig. 3.** CERN Experimental Physicist Maria Spiropulu presents on [The Future of the Higgs Boson at APS April Meeting 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB6xIH24P7Q) describing the Higgs Naturalness Problem for which "radical new ideas are needed", see @20:32. Prof. Spiropulu is now committee co-chair of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study called, [Elementary Particle Physics: Progress and Promise (EPP-2024)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/elementary-particle-physics-progress-and-promise) appealing to the general interdisciplinary science and engineering community radical new ideas are still needed, stating in the [EPP-2024 Call for Vision Papers](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2022/09/exploring-the-progress-and-promise-of-particle-physics): 

> "Therefore, our committee will investigate if and how discoveries and insights from other areas of science can be applied to addressing the fundamental questions that drive the research in EPP, including exploring and envisioning intersections and exchanges with seemingly unrelated areas in technology and engineering. Indeed, the study of the most fundamental constituents of matter and energy may be entities beyond elementary particles as we have formulated them so far, so we want to explore this, too."

The committee may take in consideration then in 1990 the author as an undergraduate intern at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Nuclear Science Division, was fortunate enough to ask, at two separate luncheons, two LBL resident Nobel Laureates Owen Chamberlain and Glenn Seaborg the same question:

> "How do particle physicists explain the physical mechanism by which virtual particles in their unobservable state create an attractive force, via force carrier particle exchange, between _hidden emitter-->carrier<--absorber particles_ - when every **observed emitter<-->carrier<-->absorber particle** interaction always results in a repulsion from any would-be line of attraction?"

Both Chamberlain and Seaborg gave the exact same answer:

> "We don't know how that works." 

Hence the [deepening crisis forcing physicists to rethink the structure of nature's laws](https://www.quantamagazine.org/crisis-in-particle-physics-forces-a-rethink-of-what-is-natural-20220301/) runs much deeper. Consider of course all the foremost modern physicists from Einstein to Feynman have stated in various terms nobody understands how quantum mechanics works. Einstein famously held the belief there must be some hidden material mechanism variables guiding the collapse of the superpositioned quantum mechanical states into the 4D spacetime human experiences. Planck somewhat less famously held the belief:

> “As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together.... We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.”

In terms then of the modern form of _The School of Athens_ debate the views of Einstein are aligned with the particle-atomist-materialism of Aristotle-Democritus vs the views of his mentor Planck being aligned with the general information field theory of forms-idealism of Plato-Parmenides.

Recently, at the [QNetworks April meeting 2022](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/event/save-the-date-qnetworks-2022/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quantumcommshub.net%2Fevent%2Fsite%2Fresearch-community%2F2022%2F&site=research-community), Prof. Spiropulu gave a talk on her Quantum Teleportation Networks after which the author was further fortunate enough to ask:

> “Is quantum teleportation considered by most physicists based on some multi-body particle material mechanism or immaterial quantum information basis?”

> [Prof. Spiropulu: “Perhaps it does not have to be either/or.”](https://twitter.com/tensornerdo/status/1513572421839642624)

Quantum teleportation, according to 4D GEM EOS, is determined to be occurring exclusively on the idealism basis of a general information field theory. The first principle for which being the LHC is entirely energized by the 4D spacetime Einstein-Maxwell electromagnetic stress-energy momentum density pressure tensor and its ATLAS CMS detectors measure only 4D electromagnetic energy density tensor pressure quantum field information.

4D GEM EOS formalizes the conceptual framework of MUH, however in doing so makes the claim no formalization exists for any such parallel universe variations of physical dimensions, constants, laws, and so on. Whereas 4D GEM EOS is formalized of the [Singular Complex System Conjecture (SCSC)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338986496_Singular_Complex_System_Conjecture) its radical new idea being there exists a singular mathematically possible universal complex system of the 4D cylindrical spacetime dimensions, physical constants, laws, holographically bound energy/mass density distribution with time the fourth dimension of length from t−∞ → t∞ with the unitary factors in Euler’s identity composed via the concept of infinity with no free parameters.

Improbably, SCSC can never be proven via its internal axioms per Gödel incompleteness only falsified by proof of MUH-_SUSY_-AdS/CFT unformalized claim external physical reality is the mathematical structure of a computable universe having parallel universe variations of physical dimensions, constants, laws, and so on.

Problem is proof of MUH-_SUSY_-AdS/CFT requires formalizing the unknown parallel universe variations of the _SUSY_-AdS/CFT hidden dimensional particle physics model all of which are zero-sized (0D) Dirac delta functional  imaginary-invisible local mathematical points which occupy no space yet operate via hidden dimensional unknown material nonlocally entangled mechanisms.

Such unnaturalness arises again as an unacknowledged attempt to solve the classical multi-body problem on the universal(multiverse!) scale while the 3-body problem is proven to be computationally intractable. Speaking of unnaturalness how do CERN particle physicists explain again how two hands clapping never touch?

And at ever higher-energies why don’t the CERN LHC beams of zero-sized δ particles which occupy no space just pass through one another without colliding?

The particle physicists answer is the Pauli exclusion principle prevents the δ particles from occupying the same space. That's fine except zero-sized _SUSY_ δ particles occupy no space so the Pauli exclusion principle itself is ironically [Not Even Wrong](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/).

Thus the background for the ChatGPT-Wolfram MUH-_SUSY_-AdS/CFT particle model prompt ends and the ChatGPT-Wolfrma MUH-4D GEM EOS field integrations prompt begins.

The 4D GEM EOS radical new idea has progressed through several stages starting here with the 2017 proposal:
