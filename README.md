The [Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008FoPh...38..101T/abstract) of Tegmark conceptualizes the mathematical origin of the universe belief held by most of modern science, while advocating MUH as the basis for the increasingly complex _SUSY_ range of conjectures and further [Beyond the Standard Model of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model) parrallel universe variations - in addition to the MUH-_SUSY_ claim to eventually be able to computationally reproduce the observed 4D spacetime human-ai experienced universe by means of a yet to be formalized MUH-_SUSY_ many-body complex system such as described by [Quantum simulation of fundamental particles and forces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00599-8) of Bauer, Davoudi, Klco, Savage. MUH-_SUSY_ multiverse theoriests can submit revised prompts to test randomness based theories.

Indeed, the study of the most fundamental constituents of matter and energy may be entities beyond elementary particles as we have formulated them so far, so we want to explore this, too."_ 

Actually, the [deepening crisis forcing physicists to rethink the structure of nature's laws](https://www.quantamagazine.org/crisis-in-particle-physics-forces-a-rethink-of-what-is-natural-20220301/) runs much deeper. In 1990 the author as an undergraduate intern at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Nuclear Science Division, had the opportunity to ask two resident Nobel Laureates Owen Chamberlain and Glenn Seaborg at two separate luncheons the same question:

> "How do particle physicists explain the physical mechanism by which virtual particles in their unobservable state create an attractive force, via force carrier particle exchange, between _hidden emitter-->carrier<--absorber particles_ - when every **observed emitter<-->carrier<-->absorber particle** interaction always results in a repulsion from any would-be line of attraction?"

Both Chamberlain and Seaborg gave the exact same answer: "We don't know how that works."
